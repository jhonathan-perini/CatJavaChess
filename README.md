Welcome to our first game using Java language.

Everybody knows something about the chess game, right?

But, what if I told you we have a ace in the hole (or as we know in Brazil, "O pulo do gato"). 

Yeah, we catch that. 

Welcome to our Cat Java Chess! Everybody loves cats, this lovely creatures. We introduce them to a serious game to make it more fun. 

You'll find thematic pieces, sounds, game screens, a little bit of onomatopeias and much more. 


We hope you enjoy this game and relax with our little cats. 





IMPORTANT: You'll need the guava library to run this program. It's embedded on the lib directory.
